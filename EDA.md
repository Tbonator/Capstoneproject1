**Exploratory Data Analysis on the Automobile Data Set**


**Introduction**

Automobile data consist of 205 rows and 26 columns. Automobiles data
consist of object, float, and int datatype, Object being the highest in
the dataset.

**DATA CLEANING**


Used to replace the NaNs in columns by the mode of values in that column

**Visualization done during data cleaning**

-   **Used missingno extension to visualize missing data in each
    column**



-   **Data after data impunity**



MISSING DATA

The data did have some missing values as depicted by the graph above.

Data impunity using mean and mode was used to deal with missing data.

DATA STORIES AND VISUALIZATIONS



Findings

-   Most of the car has a Curb Weight is in range 1900 to 3100

-   The Engine Size is inrange 60 to 190

-   Most vehicle has horsepower 50 to 125

    > hatchback 32%


**Findings**

-   curb-size, engine-size, horsepower are positively corelated

-   city-mpg,highway-mpg are negatively corelated



**Findings**

-   Mercedez-Benz ,BMW, Jaguar, Porshe produces expensive cars more than
    > 25000

-   cheverolet,dodge, honda,mitbushi, nissan,plymouth subaru,toyota

-   Vehicle with above 200 horsepower has Eight Twelve Six cyclinders



**Losses Findings**

Note :- here +3 means risky vehicle and -2 means safe vehicle

-   Increased in risk rating linearly increases in normalised losses in vehicle

-   covertible car and hardtop car has mostly losses with risk rating above 0

-   hatchback cars has highest losses at risk rating 3

-   sedan and Wagon car has losses even in less risk (safe)rating



**Findings**

-   Vehicle Mileage decrease as increase in Horsepower , engine-size,
    > Curb Weights

-   As horsepower increase the engine size increases

-   Curbweight increases with the increase in Engine Size

**Price Analysis**

-   engine size and curb-weight is positively co-related with price

-   city-mpg is negatively correlated with price as increase horsepower
    > reduces the mileage
